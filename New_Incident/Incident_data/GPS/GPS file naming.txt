We suggest a file naming convention that follows the established GIS Standard Operating Procedures on Incidents 
Projecct, aka GSTOP (http://gis.nwcg.gov) with SAR modifications. In MapSAR, you can deviate from this for what 
works most efficently for your team during an incident. But keep in mind that it can be beneficial to use the same 
format universally so you can easily share data between teams if more resources are called in, everyone is speaking 
the same language and can be easily referenced in the future. 

Filename:
 
yyyymmdd_hhmm_incidentname_gpsfeaturetype_source_csdatum

yyyymmdd = the date including the year when the data was collected
hhmm = the time of data collection using a 24-hour clock
incidentname = name of incident
gpsfeaturetype = the type of feature such as; gps_lin for line data, gps_pnt for point data or gps_pol for polygon data
source = the name of the person or the ICS position who collected the data
cs = coordinate system, such as; ll for latitude/longitude, u12n for UTM zone 12 North
datum = the datum, such as; w84 for WGS1984, 83 for NAD 1983, 27 for NAD 1927
