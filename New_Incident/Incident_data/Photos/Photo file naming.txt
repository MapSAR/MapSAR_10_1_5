We suggest a file naming convention that follows the established GIS Standard Operating Procedures on Incidents 
Projecct, aka GSTOP (http://gis.nwcg.gov) with SAR modifications. In MapSAR, you can deviate from this for what 
works most efficently for your team during an incident. But keep in mind that it can be beneficial to use the same 
format universally so you can easily share data between teams if more resources are called in, everyone is speaking 
the same language and can be easily referenced in the future. 

Filename:

yyyymmdd_hhmm_incidentname_content

yyyymmdd = the date including the year when the data was collected
hhmm = the time of data collection using a 24-hour clock
incidentname = name of incident
content = what is the file a picture of, such as; clue type, person, CDL etc.

Examples:
