We recomend an order structure to store reports. USe a structure that works for your organization, such as...

Folder = Operation period number

Folder = yyyymmdd

Folder= yyyymmdd + Operation period number

Examples

Folder = OP_01

Folder = 20120112

Folder = 20110112_OP_01

Then store your reports inside these folder, named appropriately so they can be found and printed when needed.
